### Adding Types to the Ethereum Contract instance
- #### I have used `TypeChain` npm package to create type from ABI
    - Follow the below git repo to get more information about `TypeChain`.
    - https://github.com/dethcrypto/TypeChain/
    * NOTE: You need install you connectivity library relative TypeChain dependency,
    (ex: if you are using `ethers` then it need to install `@typechain/ethers-vX` dependence)
    - TypeChain also provide examples to use these dependencies.

There are some other type generator packages available here is one of them:

I just peek random ABI for testing also not tested the code ;)
